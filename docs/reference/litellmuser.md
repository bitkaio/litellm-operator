## When to Use LiteLLMUser

- **Service accounts** for CI/CD pipelines
- **Bot users** that need API access
- **Non-SSO environments** where you manage users declaratively
- **GitOps user management** alongside SSO for specific accounts

When SSO/SCIM handles user provisioning, `LiteLLMUser` CRDs are typically not needed for human users.
